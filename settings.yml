# This file is optional for Private Plugins but good for structure if importing.
# However, since this plugin relies on a backend URL, these settings 
# need to be passed as query parameters in the Polling URL, not just here.
# TRMNL "Import" feature might use this to generate a form, but the user 
# still needs to append values to the URL or use Liquid variables if supported.
